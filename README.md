## PrimeStation One convenience control app for Android
Download from the Play Store:

### What is a PrimeStation One?  
Retro gaming via emulation on a Raspberry Pi, built on top of RetroPie.  See the PrimeStation One repo for more details:
(https://github.com/free5ty1e/primestationone)

### Features (so far):
* Scan your simple class C subnet for PrimeStation Ones, display list showing IP / hostname / version 
* Tap a found Primestation in the list to initiate download of its splashscreen / quick-reference image, then tap the same Primestation after the download completes to display the quick reference image from that Primestation full-screen (albeit the wrong orientation)
* Found Primestations are stored locally, and restored when the app is started again for quick access.  Rescanning will blank all results and provide a fresh, up-to-date list.
