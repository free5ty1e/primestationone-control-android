### Features (so far):
* Scan your simple class C subnet for PrimeStation Ones, display list showing IP / hostname / version 
* Tap a found Primestation in the list to initiate download of its splashscreen / quick-reference image, then tap the same Primestation after the download completes to display the quick reference image from that Primestation full-screen (albeit the wrong orientation)

#### TODO:
* Remote request shutdown
* Remote request reboot
* Reqeust actions / download or install modules / cloud backup in the background while you play
* Comprehensive, organized list with helpful hints for all Primestation automation goodness (control just about all the settings the Primestation has to offer from your Android)
* Webviews to view github repos for android app, Primestation, RetroPie
* Webview to act as node.js based Primestation gamepad controller, so everyone can play
* Send custom command line to Primestation
* And much, much moar.
